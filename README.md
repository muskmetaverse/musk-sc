### To launch the console, run the command:
  ```
  truffle console --network testnet
  ```
### Create a new abstraction to represent the contract at that address:
- replace "0x1234..." value by your MetaMusk contract address that you deployed before
- run bellow command in truffle console: 
  ```
  let specificInstance = await MetaMuskToken.at("0x1234...")
  ```
### Making a call to buy ICO buy bnb

- Run bellow command in truffle console
  ```
  let result = await specificInstance.buyICO({from: accounts[0], value: web3.utils.toWei('0.01', 'ether')})
  ```
### Making a call to buy ICO buy BUSD
- Make sure you have BUSD in your wallet address
- to approve BUSD for our contract, go to this link: https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0xed24fc36d5ee211ea25a80239fb8c4cfd80f12ee#writeContract (in this case, we are using BUSD contract address 0xed24fc36d5ee211ea25a80239fb8c4cfd80f12ee to integrate with MetaMusk token, you can change BUSD contract address by other BUSD contract address)
- connect to Web3 by wallet that you are using to test in truffle console
